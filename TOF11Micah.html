            Ah yes, the first, the original forumer of forumers (in TTF at the least), he’s the one who brought everyone together in the first place, starting up Book 1, ‘Reign of the Motorcycles’. But as you heard, he also had many other failed inventions, unlike his ‘Summoner 67’ (As he hated it, he had to call it that). Let’s go into two failed inventions specifically, ‘Otterman’ and ‘The Curse of S13’.
        </p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Otterman was a failed experiment to make an Otter with Mechanical bones (sound familiar?) . That failed, <i>miserably</i>, and instead the otter was turned Chair-Sized. You may be thinking ‘<i>Chair Sized?!?! That’s really big!!</i>’, and yes, that is true, but that otter was still a pup. It actually grew up to be <b>Couch-Sized</b>. Otterman grew very close to Micah’s heart, even though he was hard to feed, hard to pet, hard to sleep with, hard to find a cage, etc. etc. But Micah still loved his otter (Maybe because it was blast proof). Otterman was <i>only</i> mentioned in Chapter One of ‘Reign of the Motorcycles’, and the truth of his disappearance lies within the next story.
        </p>
        
        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
        Ohhhh, The Curse of S13 still lingers in my head, what a dreadful day for poor ol’ Micah. It was all going good, and Micah would finally be able to make other friends other than a giant otter (No offence buddy). All he had to do was run some final tests and Summoner 13 (S13) would be done. As he was running different summoning phrases, the most widely used one, ‘sheeEp’, came along the list of words. As Micah finished saying the word, S13 started acting up. “Why is it wiggling like that? It isn’t supposed to do that!” Micah said. As he was running up to the machine to stop it, the whole thing exploded and spewed this acid-like stuff <i>EVERYWHERE</i>. That star gloop (as we’ll call it) ate everything up, including his Summoner plans that he had been revising for <i>years</i>, I tell you, <i><b>years</b></i>. The star gloop kept spreading and spreading until about every single thing was destroyed (that weren’t his walls, floor, ceiling or Otterman). “I can’t believe it! None of these summoners ever work for me!” Poor ol’ Micah yelled as Otterman hid himself (where he went, I do not know). Micah sighed, and he decided to <i>give up</i>. And then, something hit him, he needed sheeEp fuel for the summoner! '<i>AGHH! What a idiotic mistake!!</i>' he thought But how was he supposed to build another summoner? The plans were destroyed by the star gloop that looked very similar to Micah’s breakfast. (and don’t go hating on him, the dude has burned store bought cinnamon rolls even after watching a youtube video on how to make them 10 times over, probably just bad luck…). I guess he’ll have to start over… <i><b>NOPE!!!</i></b> Like anybody with common sense Micah saved his plans (He might have a couple things missing) on a computer in the other room. So, he started working on Summoner 14.
        </p>
		
		<p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		At least he had Otterman... One day while Micah was working on Summoner 14, Otterman wouldn’t eat, move or be… <i>Otterman!</i> Micah did some tests on Otterman to see what was wrong with him (yes, Micah is a vet), Micah gasped when he figured out what was wrong with Otterman. “Star gloop.” Micah said under his breath. Otterman had eaten star gloop. ‘<i>What?! Otterman?! What’ll happen to him?!</i> ' you’re most likely thinking.  Well, I’ll tell you what happened, Otterman got worse, and Micah was doing everything he could to save him! It didn’t work. Right after Micah had to leave his home to help find Lexi, Otterman died. The star gloop had taken over his digestive system, and it went to his heart. Once Micah got home he cried for <i>hours</i> and I mean <i><b>hours</b></i>, but since Micah had nothing else to do (besides bury Otterman) he put every tear into a jar (not to drink it, ew) because he wanted to. But that jar would change the forumers lives one day, but for now, it was a jar of tears. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		After S14 failed, Micah decided not to stop making Summoners until one worked. The most successful (though they still failed) were: S23, S41 and S66. The failure of Summoner 66 had taught Micah many valuable things, which led to the working, Summoner 67.
		</p>
		
		<p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Many sad and insane things happened to Micah. But some of those ended up good, like the failed mech-otter creating Otterman, and S13 changing the whole direction of the Summoner plans, allowing S67 to exist. Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a good day<i>yyyyy<b>YYYYY</i> HELP HEL</b>-!
