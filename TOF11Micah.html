            Ah yes, the first, the original forumer of forumers (in TTF at the least), he’s the one who brought everyone together in the first place, starting up Book 1, ‘Reign of the Motorcycles’. But as you heard, he also had many other failed inventions, unlike his ‘Summoner 67’ (As he hated it, he had to call it that). Let’s go into two failed inventions specifically, ‘Otterman’ and ‘The Curse of S13’.
        </p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
            Otterman was an experiment to make an Otter with Mechanical bones (sound familiar?) . That failed, <i>miserably</i>, and instead the otter was turned Chair-Sized. You may be thinking ‘<i>Chair Sized?!?! That’s crazy big!!</i>’, and yes, that is true, but that otter was still a pup. He actually grew up to be <b>Couch-Sized</b>, now thats big. Otterman grew very close to Micah’s heart, even though he was hard to feed, hard to pet, hard to sleep with, hard to find a cage, etc. etc. Thats all I can tell you about Otterman so, let’s move on to the next story of Micah’s.

        </p>
        
        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
            Ohhhh, The Curse of S13 still lingers in my head, what a dreadful day for poor ol’ Micah. It was all going good, and Micah would finally be able to make other friends other than a giant otter (No offence buddy). All he had to do was run some final tests and Summoner 13 (S13) would be done. As he was running different summoning phrases, the most widely used one, ‘sheeEp’, came along the list of words. As Micah finished saying the word, S13 started acting up. “Why is it wiggling like that? It isn’t supposed to do that!” Micah said. As he was running up to the machine to stop it, the whole thing exploded and spewed this acid-like stuff <i>EVERYWHERE</i>. That star gloop (as we’ll call it) ate everything up, including his Summoner plans that he had been revising for <i>years</i>, I tell you, <i><b>years</b></i>. The star gloop kept spreading and spreading until about every single thing was destroyed (that weren’t his walls, floor or ceiling). If you look in some odd places, you’ll probably find some gloop there, that's how covered his lab was.
