            Bino’s voice echoed through the halls,“I told you, I DON’T WANT TO LISTEN TO K-POP DEMON HUNTERS!!!” “Buh- Buh- but, I can’t live without it!!!” Lexi cried out. 
        </p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Oh yes, the times before Lexi was captured, the times of Heck, as Bino liked to call it. These were moments of peace. Every other day, Lexi would go to Bino’s house (Don’t ask why) and she would sing <i>Soda</i> Pop to herself while she was there. This time, Bino had enough. “If you DON’T stop singing, I’ll kick you out of my house!!!” “FINE, I’LL LEAVE!” Lexi stomped out of Bino’s house. “Finally, peace and quiet…” Sighed Bino. He had just fallen asleep, when Sam walked in, “Got the summoner up and running again (yay!) So now can I go home?” Bino groaned, but not loud enough for Sam to hear (after all, Sam looked like happiness was coming out of his ears, gross but still). “Ok Sam, you can. Oh I’m gonna miss you…” Bino smiled sadly. “Don’t worry, we can still call each other! Maybe one day you can summon people, like kids that CAN stay!" Sam smiled. “Nah, it’ll never work.” Said Bino. 
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Not too long after, Sam left, and Bino felt lonelier than ever. His parents abandoned him not too long ago, so Bino had to care for himself and his dino named Nort. Yep, now you have a backstory to feel sorry for him! “Oh Nort,” Bino sighed. “How can losing a friend feel this bad? It aches, and now I’m bored.” Bino decided he wouldn’t get anything done if he was just laying around (facts), but just then he remembered what Sam said to him. “Maybe one day you can summon people.” Those wise words traveled to his brain and wouldn’t leave. “Of course!” He howled. “Why didn’t I think of that earlier?! Nort, bring me a wrench!” Bino worked on a special invention that was better than the first, so he says, but I don’t really believe him. Since Bino only had Lexi as a friend, he called her from outside to see his beautiful creation. “WOW! It’s amazing! Can it play <b>K-POP</b>?” Lexi beamed. Bino shook his head and explained what it was, “Maybe your brain is too undeveloped,” He paused for dramatic effect, while Lexi rolled her eyes (everyone knew she acted older than other kids her age). “This is called the <i>BNSTDNPKP</i>! It stands for the Bino Nort Summoner That Does Not Play K-POP!” Bino smiled. Lexi had trouble pronouncing it, and I totally relate. “Buh-nuh-sith-duh wha-?!” She yelled. “Bunuh-sit-duh-nuh-puh-ka-puh!” Bino told her, a little frustrated she couldn’t pronounce it. “Okay <i>Flint Lockwood</i>..” Bino rolled his eyes. “Anyways, the word to summon someone is by saying the code word.” Bino sighed. Lexi grinned, “I want to summon someone! What’s the word? Please Bino, I won’t break it. Pleassse <i>Pleeeeeeaassseee</i>?” Bino told Lexi the word, well actually words, and Lexi giggled. “Pastor Bino the Scottish Irish Dino Nort De Bozo!” She yelled giggling. Bino blushed, <i>Why did I think of those words?!</i>  And a beam of light shone on the <i>K-POP Demon Hunters</i> fan and Bino. And I’m not talking about the kind of light that comes from a flashlight, I’m talking about a light that looked like an alien abduction! Well, it wasn’t aliens but there was an abduction..
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Bino was almost blinded by the light, literally, I’m not kidding. And a teenager (who looked about 16) walked out of the summoner. Bino couldn’t recognize his face, because it was covered by a motorcycle helmet. “Who are you?!” Bino smiled as he took out his hand to shake the guy’s hand. <i><b>Silence</b></i>. “Hello?” Bino smiled. “Why am I here?” The teen said coldly. “I summoned you!” Bino said. The motorcycle dude looked at Lexi, then at Bino. “You have wasted my time. I won’t leave without something for me.” “What do you wanna take?” Said Bino, obviously terrified. He grabbed Lexi from the hand and put her on the motorcycle. “HEY, NOT HER! TAKE ME INSTEAD! SHE’S ONLY 10!” Bino grabbed the motorcycle dude and pinned him to the ground. “<b>UGH</b>! Let me go weakling!” Said motorcycle dude, as he kicked Bino and tased him. Bino let out a scream as he tried to reach out for his knife. But before he could get it the intruder pulled him away and put Lexi on the motorcycle again, but this time he tied her to it. The intruder kicked Bino in the face and left. Dizzy, Bino got up and he tried to run after him but it was too late. He fainted. 
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Bino woke up a few hours later as he gasped.“Wha- Nort? Where am I? WHERE’S LEXI!?” Then Bino remembered what happened. Bino started looking for Lexi, wincing at his injuries, but she was nowhere to be found… Then he remembered that right before he fainted, he saw MD (as he decided to call him) using the BNSTDNPKP and disappearing, “That sneaky, dumb, MD! I have to go after him! This time I’ll be ready.” <i>But how?</i>  You must be wondering, well, he added a screen that showed the last coordinates that the portal was used on, so, that's what he used to find him…
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Now, from here, you probably know what happens, he goes into the BNSTDNPKP and finds Easel, Patricia and Micah, and they team up with Trailblazer and go and stop MD. But, I’d like to tell you what it feels like to go into a summoner; a strange feeling it is. Bino felt a little hot, then he started feeling dizzy, and nauseous (Good thing he had barf bags.), then he fell to the ground breathing heavily. Then, all of a sudden, he was back to normal. He started hearing noises, “Bino! I summon thee! SheeEp!” <i>Micah!</i> Bino sighed. He heard a girl giggling. <i>Could that be her?</i> He gasped, “Lexi? Is that you?”
