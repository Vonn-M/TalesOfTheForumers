        <i>I’m ALMOST there!</i> A seven year old me was climbing a mango tree (Not suitable for a prince), when my fingers touched the fruit there was a loud shout “Prince Vonn, get down here!” My mom <i><b>Regina Oreo</b></i> yelled. You <i><b>do not</b></i> want to get on her bad side so I jumped off the tree, and went inside. My dad, King Alabaster of C&C, did not like my idea either. My country was at war at the time, but since I was seven, I didn’t really care. My dad punished me by sending me to bed without cookies ‘n cream ice cream! I went to my room and… Yes, I cried. “One day!” I sobbed “One day I’ll treat my kids nicely! Not like them! <i><b>I HATE THEM!</b></i>” And kids, never say that about your parents, they're just doing it for your own good. 
        </p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		A few years later, when I was twelve. A peace treaty began between the Kingdom of Caramel, and our kingdom. But the King of Caramel, King Gooey, was still afraid C&C might attack! So, he offered his daughter, Princess Maddie, to marry me! I was shocked, cringed out, and mad! Wasn’t I supposed to choose who I would marry?! Thankfully, Princess Maddie was in love with someone else: Prince Martin. But shocking news happened. Prince Martin was found with a dagger in his back the night before his and Maddie’s wedding. “You killed him, didn’t you?!” Maddie cried, while I was figuring out who <i><b>REALLY</b></i> killed him! “I did not! Martin was… Like a…. Brother…” I did not kill Martin, but I didn’t like him either. “You just killed him so you could marry me!” She yelled. “PFFT- Heck no! No offence but, you’re kind of uhh-” I sputtered, I didn’t want to sound rude. “HA! I knew it! You DID kill him!” Maddie ran out crying. King Gooey did not like this, he was worried I would attack them (maybe he thought I was older..), so he demanded that I take his daughter’s hand in marriage. But this time my dad agreed. I went up to my balcony and looked at the stars, just then, my dad knocked (even though it was more of a bang) on my door. “Come in..” I said, trying to hold back my groan. Alabaster tried to convince me to marry Maddie, he thought of dumb excuses like, “She’s beautiful. You’re lucky. She loves you. You’d be King much faster…” “Dad,” I started. “Please.. Don’t make me marry her. She loved Prince Martin, like <i>OBSESSION</i> love. If I want to marry someone, <i>I</i> want to choose who I want to marry, a regular girl, not a Martin fangirl.” My dad got quiet. Maybe he opened his eyes! “You’re marrying her. Tomorrow.” And he left. “DAD!? NO!” I screamed. <i>Fine.</i> I thought. <i>If he doesn't respect my wishes, then I’ll just leave!</i>

		That night, I ran away from home, to my old friend's house. They kept care of me and understood my reasoning (or as my dad called it, excuses). I lived there for a year. Once I moved out of the house I ran to the kingdom of Vanilla, where at the time a new king was being crowned. One day, about 3 months after I had moved to Vanilla, news came in that Alabaster and Regina were poisoned, and dead. I quickly picked up a Taxi and he drove me to C&C. I got to the palace just in time, right before my <i>rotten, no good, stinky</i> uncle Karl was going to be crowned. “Well, well, well, if it ain’t ma’ good fer’ nothin’ nephew..” Uncle Poophead said (please forgive my immatureness). “Looks like I’ve come right in time.” I said. “TOOO bad Vinny! I’ve already been chosen to be the next king!” Said Karl. “Well, that really isn’t true, we <i>did</i> say that he had 14 days, and he has come in that time. Sorry Karl, but you’ve been replaced.” One of the knights said. “AGHHHHH I’VE BEEN OUT KINGED, AGAIN!!!” Yelled my uncle who was in desperate need of a bath. “Again?” I asked, but Karl put his hat (which is held together by duct tape and a praver by the way) and left. I decided to take in what had just happened so I turned to go to the palace, but all the soldiers were bowing to me, and they were all saying, “Long live King Vonn of Cookies and Cream!”

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		The next day I was crowned. Not much longer after that, I had heard that a couple Vanilla generals killed Maddie’s parents. She blamed it on me (Why? I don’t know.), and declared war on C&C. The war lasted for 2 weeks and eventually I defeated her. To celebrate my win, I took her crown back to C&C.

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Only 3 years later, C&C was completely hidden underground. The kingdom of Chocolate started invading C&C and kidnapping multiple people and knights (this took place because Chocolate wanted to become allies with C&C, but I had declined, taking sides with Vanilla instead.)

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Later that year, I met Easel, Bino, Trailblazer and the rest of the group, but how can you know for sure they’ll be your best friend, then turn on you five seconds later? Well, I guess you can tell they’re REALLY your friends. And these friends are like my best friends! The ennnnnAHHH THERE’S A CAT CHASING ME! <i><b>WATCH THE CLAWS! WATCH THE CLAW-</b></i>
