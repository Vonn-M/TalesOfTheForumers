            There was just 1 week until Christmas, the forumers were all sitting around a fire, now a lot has happened to the forumers. They were all happy they could celebrate the holidays together, and take a break for once. “Ah, what a year…” Sighed Bino. “Aren’t you glad that we can forget about what happened and y’know, just hang out?” Said Micah. “IT ISN’T OVER YET!!!” Yelled a voice about 50 yards away.
        </p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		 Vonn walked into the room and Lexi jumped. “<b>AHHHHH!!! WHO’S THAT?!?!!?!?!</b>” Vonn started to laugh very loudly, so loud in fact, that TB could hear it two walls away. As Vonn’s laugh started to get quieter, he said, “I look like this because the electric mixer started to act up and it spit egg and molasses everywhere. Then, Santi accidentally flipped the bowl filled with all of my dry mix, and that was thrown on me. I was just about to change and take a shower.” Lexi rolled her eyes and said, “Boys are soo disgusting!” “Do you think I wanted to get dirty?” Replied Vonn, as the others started cracking up. Santi walked in the room and started snickering. Vonn stared at him. <i>Did he do that on purpose??</i>
        </p>
		
		<p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		“Ah, only one week before Christmas!” Bino sighed as he effortlessly (Or, so he thought.) wrapped the presents he was going to give to his friends. Then, he heard a noise that sounded like a whoosh and the room got cold. Bino jumped up and yelled,“<b>AHHHH!!</b> Was that a <i>GHOST</i>?!!!” Micah replied, “No! Bwhahaha! That’s what happens when the shower turns on, I’ve been trying to fix that.” “Oh.” “But are you sure?” Bino whimpered. “Yes, I’m sure.” Said Micah, trying to hold back a laugh. “Well, okay. And stop laughing at me!” Bino blushed. “I’m not laughing!” Micah answered, but he couldn’t hold it in any longer. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		10 minutes later, Vonn came out of the shower, with a shirt that was too long. “What took you so long? Molasses in your hair?” Snickered Santi. Vonn just gave him the T_T look, and walked back into the kitchen. Santi walked into the bathroom <i>WITH HIS SOCKS</i> (Death guaranteed.), and he looked down, paled, and screamed, “<i><b>VONN WHY DO YOU GET THE FLOOR WET?! BROOO..</b></i>” Vonn replied, “<i>WHY DO YOU THINK?! ALMOST ALL OF THE TOWELS WERE BEING WASHED AFTER YOU COMPLETELY EXPLODED THAT 1 GALLON WATER BOTTLE!!?</i>” “Oh, sorry…” Santi blushed, while looking at his completely soaked socks.

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		3 Days later… 
        <br>
        <br>
        Trailblazer was playing Bloxd with his new ghost controlled hand that Micah made him the month before. “Yes.. Yes.. YES!!” Trailblazer screamed after he had just won Bedwars. “What’s wrong Trailblazer?” Jett was walking by the door after he had heard the little girl shrieks.  “Nothing. Just <b><i>winning</i></b> some bedwars.” Trailblazer said confidently, while doing a silly pose. Jett laughed, “O…k. I’ll leave you alo-” “<i>NO. YOU SHALL WATCHEST I PLAYETH.</i>” Interrupted Trailblazer. “<i>AND MARSHMALLOW AS WELL!</i>” And so, Jett watched Trailblazer play, but when he tried to win another Bedwars match, he couldn’t, which bored Jett to tears. Eventually, after <b><i>6</i></b> playthroughs, TB finally won a match, but by then, Jett had already left.
		</p>
		
		<p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		After that disaster, Trailblazer decided to go to Micah’s shop and check on the progress of his new invention, the “Ghost to Person Machine” or GTPM. This machine was going to be very important to Trailblazer because, well, the name says what it does, it turns a visible ghost into a living being. When TB got to his lab, he saw no Micah. <i>Why isn’t Micah here? He’s always here… Huh, I’ll go check the living room.</i> Trailblazer thought.
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		When Trailblazer got to the living room, the only people he saw here were Bino, Vonn, Lexi and Santi. “Does anyone know where Micah is?” Trailblazer asked. Bino shook his head and said, “No, I haven’t seen him in a couple hours.” “Didn’t he say he was going to the store to get eggnog?” Santi replied. “That's right! He did!” Bino said. “Ok then, got it.” Trailblazer said as he became invisible.
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		When Trailblazer got to the store, he looked everywhere, but he still couldn’t find Micah. <i>AGHHH! Where is he?!?! I <b>need</b> to talk to him!</i> Trailblazer thought.
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Right as TB got home and hopped on his computer, he heard a noise in Micah’s lab. But when he got into the lab, he saw nothing. This happened 4 times, and Trailblazer eventually gave up looking for Micah.
		</p>

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
        Finally, after an hour of non-stopping sounds from Micah’s lab, Micah himself walked out. Trailblazer sprinted to Micah and yelled in his face, “<b>MICAH MICAH MICHAH MIGSG MIFAX MIBUTTHURTS MICARS MICAAAAAH MIC-</b>” “Get to the point!” Micah interrupted. “Micah?! Where were you?” Trailblazer said calmly. “Well first I went to the store to get eggnog, but then I remembered I needed to get something for a present for Vonn. So, I went to the That One Parts Store and got materials for the present, but <i>then</i> I forgot the tape. So now I’m making indestructible tape!” Trailblazer sighed, “Look we…Um... We have to…Talk about this Christmas stuff. I don’t really feel.. It feels ridiculous, and before you call me ‘Scrooge’,” He paused. “ I just felt you had to kno-” He was interrupted by Reese, who had just walked in. “Uggghh, you won’t BELIEVE the line at the supermarket! Oh hey Micah. Trailblazer.” He nodded. “Let’s talk later.” Trailblazer whispered. And he walked away.

        <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
		Christmas Eve:
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>No doubt this is going to be the biggest Christmas ever.</i> Thought Bino, as he put the last present under the tree. He stared at his ornament: Jesus is the reason for the season. He smiled at it and went to enjoy dinner. “Okay everyone,” Yelled Bino, after everyone had gulped down the leftover pizza. “It’s time to read a little from good ol’ Luke, and remember a special someone’s birthday.. Our Saviour’s!” Everyone cheered as they went to fight over the best seat on the couch. Bino read the whole chapter, but I’ll only give you a sample:

        <p class="story-paragraph-small TimesNewRomanFont">
		<i>“And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
        <br>
        <br>
        And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
        <br>
        <br>
        And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
        <br>
        <br>
        For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
        <br>
        <br>
        And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
        <br>
        <br>
        And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
        <br>
        <br>
        Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
        <br>
        <br>
        And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.
        <br>
        <br>
        And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
        <br>
        <br>
        And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.
        <br>
        <br>
        And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
        <br>
        <br>
        But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.”</i> (Luke 2:8-11 KJV) 

		</p>
		
         <p class="story-paragraph drop-cap">
            Then, they sang Silent Night. It was a little off-key at times, but they still made an effort. Bino, Micah, TB, Santi, and all of the other forumers felt the Christmas spirit (And the Holy Spirit.), which made them happier than ever, and sent them to bed, with a smile on their face. 

            <i>Maybe Christmas isn’t so bad…</i> Trailblazer smiled.
         </p>
